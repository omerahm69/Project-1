# project-1
This is my first project within the Fullstack Developer program at Code Institute.
This project is about creating a website using HTML and CSS. 
The Website will be an informative website about the Urban Heritage of the Old City of Massawa.
Massawa is located on the southwestern coast of the Red Sea and is the main port of the state of Eritrea.
The old city covers an area of 2,50 squares kilometers, and its population reached between 8,000 - 9,000.
An Eritrean civil initiative that seeks to dokument and protect the urban heritage of the ancient city of Massawa and spread awareness about it. 
Its idea was launched bt the Samhar Cultural Association in Stockholm, Sweden in Februari 2020, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the liberation of Massawa from the Ethiopian occupation.
